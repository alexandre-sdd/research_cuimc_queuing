# Project Journal

## Purpose

This is the running project journal for the appointment-simulation work.

Going forward, after each completed task I should:

- evaluate what remains to do
- update this journal if the task changes project status, assumptions, or priorities
- make a git commit for the completed work

## Current State

As of 2026-04-08, the project includes:

- a reusable simulation package in [appointment_simulation](/Users/alexandresepulvedadedietrich/Documents/School/Columbia/Research/appointment_simulation)
- a formal note in [first_two_class_simulation_note.tex](/Users/alexandresepulvedadedietrich/Documents/School/Columbia/Research/Documents/generated_notes/first_two_class_simulation_note.tex)
- a compiled PDF in [first_two_class_simulation_note.pdf](/Users/alexandresepulvedadedietrich/Documents/School/Columbia/Research/Documents/generated_notes/first_two_class_simulation_note.pdf)
- a literature synthesis in [knowledge_appointment_dynamics.md](/Users/alexandresepulvedadedietrich/Documents/School/Columbia/Research/Documents/generated_notes/knowledge_appointment_dynamics.md)
- a status memo in [simulation_status_and_next_steps.md](/Users/alexandresepulvedadedietrich/Documents/School/Columbia/Research/Documents/generated_notes/simulation_status_and_next_steps.md)
- a behavior-only notebook in [behavior_functions.ipynb](/Users/alexandresepulvedadedietrich/Documents/School/Columbia/Research/Notebooks/behavior_functions.ipynb)
- a FCFS-only simulation-results notebook in [simulation.ipynb](/Users/alexandresepulvedadedietrich/Documents/School/Columbia/Research/Notebooks/simulation.ipynb)
- a policy-comparison notebook in [policy_comparisons.ipynb](/Users/alexandresepulvedadedietrich/Documents/School/Columbia/Research/Notebooks/policy_comparisons.ipynb)

## Implemented Model Features

- two patient classes
- rolling 15-day horizon and 25 slots per day by default
- slot-level calendar simulation
- offered delay `\tau` separated from residual-delay state `r`
- delay-sensitive balking
- delay-sensitive no-show
- daily pre-appointment cancellation described by `\phi_i(\tau)`
- FCFS policy
- latest-available policy
- reserved-capacity policy
- class-specific booking-window policy
- aggregate summaries, class summaries, and daily journals
- access-target reporting and utilization reporting

## Immediate Next Tasks

These are the highest-priority next steps based on the current scope.

1. Add explicit overbooking logic and its metrics.
2. Add reminder / confirmation interventions as parameterized behavior changes.
3. Add a payer-mix and margin layer for financial analysis.
4. Introduce a cleaner mapping from panel size `N` to the total arrival rate `\lambda` and class mix `p`, or equivalently to class-specific rates `\lambda_i`.
5. Calibrate assumptions once scheduling-process details and Columbia Doctors data are available.

## Document Review Follow-Up

The standalone review of the initial formulation note identified three document-level follow-ups:

1. The metrics section now matches the implemented simulator distinction between `balked`, `no_offer`, and `not_booked`.
2. The note now has a clearer front-end reader guide and a more hierarchical section structure.
3. A possible remaining document-level improvement would be to decide whether the formulation note should stay purely technical or absorb a compact scope/status section for supervisor-facing use.

## Most Recent Completed Task

- Added a table of contents to [first_two_class_simulation_note.tex](/Users/alexandresepulvedadedietrich/Documents/School/Columbia/Research/Documents/generated_notes/first_two_class_simulation_note.tex) so the document is easier to navigate as a standalone note.
- Added visually distinct boxes for the central feedback loop, the main calendar examples, and the key modeling distinction between residual delay `r` and booking-time delay `\tau`.
- Refined the presentation so the examples read more clearly as worked examples rather than as ordinary body text.
- Fixed the `tcolorbox` definitions so boxed headings render their intended titles rather than the literal word `title`.
- Recompiled [first_two_class_simulation_note.pdf](/Users/alexandresepulvedadedietrich/Documents/School/Columbia/Research/Documents/generated_notes/first_two_class_simulation_note.pdf) after the visual pass and formatting changes.
- Identified one remaining minor LaTeX layout warning in the schematic calendar table; it is small enough for now but may be worth cleaning up later if the note is polished further for external circulation.

## Updated Task Assessment

1. Add explicit overbooking logic and its metrics.
2. Add reminder / confirmation interventions as parameterized behavior changes.
3. Add a payer-mix and margin layer for financial analysis.
4. Introduce a cleaner mapping from panel size `N` to the total arrival rate `\lambda` and class mix `p`, or equivalently to class-specific rates `\lambda_i`.
5. Calibrate assumptions once scheduling-process details and Columbia Doctors data are available.
